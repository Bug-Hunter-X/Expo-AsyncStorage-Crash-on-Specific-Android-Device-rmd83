While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the use of AsyncStorage.  The error message was vague, and standard troubleshooting steps (clearing caches, reinstalling packages) didn't resolve it. The application would crash on startup without any clear indication of the source of the problem in the console logs.  The problem only appeared on a specific device (Android).
